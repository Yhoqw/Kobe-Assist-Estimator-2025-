“Kobe Assist” Calculator
Estimating how many times points are generated by a team off of a players misses per game

This was originally a project I made as my AI-102 semester project. Since then I have rebuilt it using the NBA_api. Instead of taking an estimate this time this gives and accurate kobe assist average for a 10 game sample for the top 8 scorers in the NBA.

The report and Original python lab project are in another branch of this github repo
