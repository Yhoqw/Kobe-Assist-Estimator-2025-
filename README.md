Basketball analytics often emphasizes scoring, assists, and efficiency, but one
underappreciated aspect is the value generated from missed field goals — particularly
when those misses result in offensive rebounds and subsequent scoring. This
phenomenon is informally known as a "Kobe Assist," referring to instances where a player’s
missed shot leads directly to a scoring opportunity for their team, typically via an offensive
rebound and putback.

The aim of this project is to quantify the number of points generated through these Kobe
Assists by analyzing NBA player statistics using Python.
To analyze player-level NBA data and identify missed field goals.
To estimate how often a player's own missed shots lead to team points via offensive
rebounding rate of his team.
To create a visualization of the estimated Kobe Assists for top NBA scorers.
To build a modular Python program that can be reused for future datasets or seasons.

Software: Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib
